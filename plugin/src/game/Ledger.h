// 1.4 / B2 — the request ledger. ★PERMANENT WIRING since the A-section
// repairs: on by default, because the two-phase slot drop (B3-b) completes
// only through Confirm/Expire -- a default-off ledger left the commit half
// ownerless. "!ledger = 0" is a per-session escape hatch for bisecting a
// report, never a shipping configuration.
//
// Every ask we make of the engine is written down here BEFORE the call, and
// struck off when the engine's event confirms it. This is condition (A) of
// PLAN §7, and B0 turned it from a nice idea into a requirement:
//
//   ★**A confirmation is one request consuming one event -- never a count of
//   events.** Using a poison or a potion produces TWO ContainerChanged for one
//   actual change (§8-3, measured across five rounds). Anything that counts
//   arrivals decides that consumables were confirmed twice, and in B3 that
//   becomes a board losing two of everything it drinks.
//
// What B2 does NOT do yet: roll anything back. The board is still engine
// authority, so there is no speculative state to undo -- OnExpire is where B3
// will hook that in. What B2 answers is **how often a request is never
// confirmed at all**, which is the number that says how much §5-2 actually
// costs.
//
// Ages are counted in FRAMES, not wall clock: the grid menu pauses the game,
// and a real-time deadline would expire requests while the player reads a
// tooltip. (CLAUDE.md's timer rule, same reasoning.)
