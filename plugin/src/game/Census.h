// 1.4 / B1 — kind-level audit, one step above B0. Observation-only at birth;
// promoted to permanent wiring below (★★PROMOTED).
//
// B0 counted FORMS. That is enough to ask "did the engine tell us everything",
// and the answer was yes. It is not enough to run a board: two iron daggers are
// the same form and different things the moment one of them is tempered.
//
// B1 counts KINDS -- form + InstanceSig -- and reports what moved between them.
// The question it exists to answer is PLAN §3 / REVIEW B-2:
//
//   **When N units of one form all change value at once, can the vanished
//   kinds be paired with the appeared ones without guessing?**
//
// If they cannot, 1.4 has not removed the matching problem, only moved it into
// the census, and §9 has a stopping rule about that.
//
// ★It records the RAW VALUES too, not just the signature. The pairing rule in
// §3 is "closest value first" -- and a signature is a hash, which has no
// distance. That rule cannot be evaluated, let alone implemented, from sigs
// alone. Learning this is itself part of what B1 was for.
//
// ★★PROMOTED: ON BY DEFAULT, and no longer observation-only. Each Take now
// ASSIGNS the pairs it used to merely rank -- greedily, fewest changed axes
// first, normalised distance as the tiebreak (the B1-measured rule, PLAN
// §8-4) -- and the rebuild's relabel block consumes the assignment through
// TakePair. Before this, N vacated pools met M arriving pools in HASH ORDER,
// which is no order at all: two same-form blades re-tempered in one
// grindstone session (values move, counts do not, no event fires) could come
// back seated in each other's cells at the next menu open, the very §1(b)
// violation the census was built to measure. The assignment only concerns
// UNWORN units -- a worn item is off the board, so combat charge drain has
// nothing to relabel. "!census = 0" remains as an emergency cutoff (the
// ledger's promotion pattern).
